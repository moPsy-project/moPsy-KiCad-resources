# moPsy KiCad resources

> Various resources I use in my [KiCad](https://www.kicad.org/) projects

Currently just a dump of my KiCad resources (symbols, footprints).
They will be ordered and sorted into proper repositories later.

The [circuit attic](circuit_attic.kicad_sch) contains parts of schematics that have not been used, but are stored for later reference.

## Dependencies

KiCad version 7 is the current baseline for accessing files in this repository.
